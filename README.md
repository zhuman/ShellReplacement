# Z-Shell

> NOTE: This project is archived from 2007. It is not being actively developed.

Z-Shell is an open-source, managed, Windows replacement shell written entirely in VB.NET. If you don't know what a Windows shell is or why you would want to replace it, see the [FAQ](wiki/FAQ.md). The end vision is to have a highly customizable, theme/style-based shell and editor. You will be able to actually design every part of the shell from menus to panels to taskbars using a fairly simple theme editor.

Z-Shell is managed by [Z-Systems](http://www.z-sys.org/). The Z-Systems site also contains a [Z-Shell](http://www.z-sys.org/products/zshell.aspx) page.

## Where are we now?

Z-Shell is currently in a very unstable state. There is no file system browser yet, but the current setup consists of a working start menu, and working taskbar, and a working notification area. Small pieces are missing in what is there, and there are probably many bugs. It is not yet recommended that you use it regularly, except for testing.
