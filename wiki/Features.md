# Features



There are a number of things that Z-Shell must have before it can be considered a competent "shell". Since the shell is customizable, all of these features are available, but none have to be used in any particular shell theme.



* Configurable taskbar-like task manager

* Start menu all programs tree

* Listing of your most recent programs, documents, and default programs

* Can be used with Explorer folder windows
